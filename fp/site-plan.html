        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will be most visitors’ first point of contact, and as such will include a brief description of what Krav Maga is and why it was developed. It will also include information on the founder as well as who brought it to the United States from Israel. It should be noted that I will focus on who brought the system I train in to the United States. However, there are other schools, but only a handful of people studied directly under the founder and brought Krav Maga here with his blessing. Finally, it will differentiate Krav Maga from Martial Arts by highlighting key points of where the two diverge.  With a focus on the lack of a sporting aspect and how that can be a detriment to training in a traditional martial art rather than a dedicated self-defense system. This will wrap up with an analysis of the Krav Maga logo and what it means and how that guides instruction and progress.

      <h3>[Self-Defense]</h3>
      <p>
        This page will focus on scenarios where knowing how self-defense can make a difference in a variety of situations. We will also go over different defenses that are covered in the level 1 curriculum as well as how they relate to higher level techniques and defenses. In addition, we will also touch on soft techniques that can be employed when the threat isn’t that serious but still needs to be addressed. One example often used in my training is controlling a friend or family member who has had too much to drink. On the flipside I will also go over compliance techniques that can be used for controlling someone that is unruly and doesn’t need to be handled with care. This page will also go over misconceptions about self-defense and debunk commonly shared myths. There will also be a paragraph dedicated to situational awareness, what things are missed by most people and how staying alert can be used as a preventative measure. I will also include examples to highlight these points.

      <h3>[Benefits]</h3>
      <p>
        In this section we will cover the benefits of training in Krav Maga over traditional Martial Arts as well as other self-defense systems. We will begin with increased resilience and confidence. The challenging and intense nature of training and testing often fosters increased mental and physical fortitude. Because training is done from a position of disadvantage situational awareness increases along with a sense of confidence that new challenges aren’t as bad as they may seem at first. I will also offer my own testimony of this. Specifically, I’ll go over my first and second test and how I endured. Beyond that I will cover how those tests impacted me in my professional and personal life. I will wrap up with an outline of the various belt levels, what they cover, the amount of time someone has to train to advance, and how they build on each other. I will also briefly touch on weapons defenses and how they relate to regular techniques. Most commonly these are gun and knife defenses, but can also include stick (such as a staff or bat). Finally, I will cover the fitness related benefits that can be enjoyed when one regularly trains. The most obvious of these is weight loss, followed by improved cardio and stamina.
